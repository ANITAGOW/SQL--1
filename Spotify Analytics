With this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
Secondly,  I created a table to insert the dowloaded Spotify data into.
Then, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

//** CREATING THE TABLE**//

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

//** I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.**//

//** Next, I explored the data using the following queries**//. 


//** First, I determined the most popular track and artist***///

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10


//***2. Which track has the highest danaceability?**//

SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
limit 10


//***3.Which artist released the longest song?**//

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 5


//** 4. WHAT is the average danceability for the 5 most popular songs?**//

SELECT AVG(danceability) AS
average_danceability
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE track_id IN (SELECT track_id
                   FROM Spotifydata
                   ORDER BY popularity DESC
                   LIMIT 5)
