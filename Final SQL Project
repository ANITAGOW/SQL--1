With this project, I downloaded a database called Chinook that has te following schemas; Playlists, Invoices, customers, Media Type, Playlist track, Tracks, Genres, invoice items, artists, albums and employees
Then I performed the following analytics using sql.


//** 1.Show the list of all customers from USA**//

SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE Country = "USA"


//** 2.show a list of employees whose job title is IT Staff**//

SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Title = "IT Staff"


//*** 3.Locate the invoices for clients in USA. The final table should include the client's full name, invoice number, invoice date, and billing Country**///

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN customers as cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "USA"


//** 4.Give a query that displays the invoice connected to each sales representative. The whole name of the Sales Agent should be included in the final table**//

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM Employees emp 
JOIN Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId


//** 5.With each invoice line ID, create a query that contains the name of the purchased track AND the artist's name**//

SELECT art.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON art.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;


//** 6. Find the employee who has the highest number of customers assigned to them**//

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, COUNT(cus.Customerid) AS Customer_count
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
LEFT JOIN customers cus ON emp.employeeid = cus.SupportRepID
GROUP BY emp.employeeid
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 1


//** 7.What is the highest sales amount per invoice**//

SELECT AVG(total) AS average_sales_amount
FROM invoices

//** 8. Give a query that displays total sales by Countries. Which Country has customers that made the largest purchases?***///

SELECT i.billingcountry, sum(total) as Total_Sales
FROM invoices i
GROUP BY billingcountry
ORDER BY totalsales DESC


//** 9. Retrieve the top 5 best-selling albums, alongwith the total number of tracks and the total sales amount for each album.**//

SELECT a.Title, COUNT(t.Trackid) AS track_count, SUM(ii.UnitPrice * ii.Quantity) AS total_sales
FROM albums a
JOIN tracks t ON a.Albumid = t.Albumid
JOIN invoice_items ii ON t.Trackid = ii.Trackid
GROUP BY a.Albumid
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5


//** 10.Give a query that includes the Album name, Media type, and Genre and displays all the Tracks**/// 

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN media_Types m
ON m.mediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g
ON g.genreId = t.genreId



//** 11 Show a list the number of employees who are Sales Support Agents***///

SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"


//** 12 Which employee generated the highest sales revenue **//

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, SUM(ii.UnitPrice * ii.Quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmplOyeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
JOIN invoice_items ii ON i.Invoiceid = ii.InvoiceId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1


//** 13 How much was sold overall in 2011?**//

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
